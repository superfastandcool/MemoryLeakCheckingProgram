# Memory Leak Program
An experimental program that checks a file for memory leaks.


## Using the program

Follow the steps to check for any memory leaks.
1. Compile the program.
2. Ensure the file to be checked is in the same directory as the executable.
3. Redirect the input and execute the program. For example:
      ``` shell
      ./executable_name < NameOfFileToBeChecked.cpp
      ```

## To do
- [x] Create basic program to check for memory leaks in single-file programs.
- [ ] Highlight where the memory leak is and how it could be rectified.
- [ ] Ensure program handles edge cases etc.
- [ ] Ensure program can check multi-file programs.


## Important information
There are known limitations to this program. Neither the author of this program nor the owner of
this program take any liability for any loss resulting from following the steps. The use of this program is
entirely at the risk of the user.
